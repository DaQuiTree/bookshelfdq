      I understand that, and you're welcome to bring it up with Alec directly
      and see if he wants to relicense his code as LGPL... but at this point,
      it was enough to just get it consistent and documented as to what it was
      released under. This wasn't actually a license change, just a
      clarification of the licensing that was already in place.=20

      the original license (before moving to sourceforge -- aka, 2.7) was not=20
      GPL-2 ... it was a modified artistic license ... i didnt notice the license=
      =20
      change until it was mentioned in the latest notes.

      unlike the old license, GPL-2 prevents people from using cracklib unless th=
      eir=20
      applications are also GPL-2 which imo is just wrong. it isnt the place of =
      a=20
      library to dictact to application writes what license they should be using.=
      =20
      thus LGPL-2.1 enters to fill this void.

      Seems like the ideal thing here would be for you and the other distro
      maintainers to get together with Alec in a conversation and come to a
      decision as to what licensing scheme y'all want. I haven't really done
      much other than cleaning up the packaging and patches and a small bit of
      additional code, so whatever licensing y'all come up with is fine by me.

      I am sympathetic. Guys, what do you reckon?

      What I am hearing so far is that LGPL makes sense, since it can be
      linked with any code, not just GPL...

      I would like to see it under LGPL as well. I think it is in everyone's
      best interests to have as secure systems as possible, and I think tainting
      it via GPL will just make it less likely that the library gets used, and
      will not usually cause companies/developers to GPL the dependent code
      (where it is not already GPL).

      I like GPL, I use it when I can, but I don't think that it's the correct
      license in this situation.

      My apologies for not chiming in in anything resembling a reasonable
      timeframe.

      I'd also suggest the LGPL, for the reason you noted above. Alternately,
      GPLv2 with the option of using the library under a later version of the
      GPL would permit applications which were released under version 3 of the
      GPL to use the library, too, which would be sufficient for the packages
      which are included in Fedora. FWIW, I'd personally lean toward LGPL.

      In any case, I thank you both for working on sorting this out.

      Cheers,

      Nalin

      looks like everyone is OK with LGPL-2.1 (GNU Lesser license), so can we make
      the change now ?

-----------
BELOW IS ORIGINAL LICENSING DISCUSSION RE CHANGING TO GPL from Artistic.
-----------

CrackLib was originally licensed with a variant of the Artistic license. In the 
interests of wider acceptance and more modern licensing, it was switched with
the original author's blessing to GPL v2. 

This approval was carried out in email discussions in 2005, and has been reconfirmed 
as of 2007-10-01 with the following email from Alec Muffett. 

The below email references nneul@umr.edu address, as that is the address
that was used at the time. For any future emails regarding this, please
use nneul@neulinger.org.

The license for my code in the Cracklib distribution is henceforth GPL.

Happy now? :-)
